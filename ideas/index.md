title: Big Ideas and Questions

---

As we go about our survey of interesting things, we will collect interesting
questions and ideas that might make for good semester projects. If I miss one,
let me know so I can add it.

_For the record, I would love to have you all learn to use the 3d printer in the
library and use it as part of your project. If you get a good idea, think about
the way in which a printed model might help illustrate an idea. Then I will
push the library to let us play._


## Knots

1. How do the subtleties of the Dowker notation work?
2. What might be another system for coherently labeling knots?
3. How did Reidemeister show that his moves were good enough? (hurr, hurr)
4. What are other invariants for knots?
5. How does one go about deciding on the official census of knots with $k$ crossings?
   In particular, how does one decide if a knot is prime or composite?
