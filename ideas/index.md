title: Big Ideas and Questions

---

As we go about our survey of interesting things, we will collect interesting
questions and ideas that might make for good semester projects. If I miss one,
let me know so I can add it.

_For the record, I would love to have you all learn to use the 3d printer in the
library and use it as part of your project. If you get a good idea, think about
the way in which a printed model might help illustrate an idea. Then I will
push the library to let us play._


## Knots

1. How do the subtleties of the Dowker notation work?
2. What might be another system for coherently labeling knots?
3. How did Reidemeister show that his moves were good enough? (hurr, hurr)
4. What are other invariants for knots?
5. How does one go about deciding on the official census of knots with $k$ crossings?
   In particular, how does one decide if a knot is prime or composite?
6. 3d print some knots with interesting properties

I want you to see that each of these ideas has several ways to handle it. If you
enjoyed studying knots, talk to me and I can help you pick something out.

## Surfaces

1. 3d print some interesting surfaces.
2. try to knit a projective plane and show us why it is hard to finish


## Patterns

1. 3d print some geometrically accurate orbifolds.
2. Study the classification of patterns on a sphere.
3. Study the classification of patterns for wallpaper borders (frieze patterns).
4. Give an accurate history of the tiling problem:
    * What kind of tilings can you make with a single triangle, quadrilateral,
    etc, etc.
    * What makes pentagons so hard?
    * Who figured out what about pentagonal tilings?

## Be Inspired

Do something kinda neat.
