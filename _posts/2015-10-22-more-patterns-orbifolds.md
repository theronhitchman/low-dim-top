title: More Time with Patterns and Orbifolds
---

We looked at the pentagonal tilings today and tried to classify them by their
symmetries. We found this weird phenomenon that led us to a conjecture:

> Conjecture: Let \\(\mathcal{T}\\) be a tiling of the plane by a single
> pentagonal tile. The Conway signature of this tiling as a planar pattern
> involves only gyrational points.

Then we talked about orbifolds for a bit. We discussed how the bits and pieces of
the signature notation corresponds to the geometric features of the orbifold.

#### Homework:

Play kindergartener and do crafts. For as many patterns as you can stomach, enlarge
the pictures and make orbifolds. Use scissors and tape. Make the subject tactile and
get acquainted with it.
