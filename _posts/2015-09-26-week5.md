title: Week Five Wrap Up

---

During this week, you all worked at recognizing a whole cast of nefarious 
surfaces. I gave you a packet with a variety of sewing patterns, or surfaces
represented by drawings. Your task is to find out the invariants for all of 
them and come to an understanding of each surface as an individual.

We worked on this task all week. For next week, I hope you will finish this 
task, and then start to think about how you can _organize_ all of the surfaces
in some useful way.
