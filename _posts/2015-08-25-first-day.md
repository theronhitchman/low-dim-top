Welcome! This will be our class blog. We had a productive first meeting, and I am happy to have met you all.

Today we introduced ourselves to the concept of a knot. We even made some examples and learned to represent them by _planar projection_ drawings.

#### Assignment for Thursday 8/27:
*Task 1.* Work on our questions from this afternoon.

  - How can we tell if two knots drawn differently are really different?
  - Does it have to do with the number of regions of the plane around the knot?

    After some talk, it seemed we might need to consider the _minimal_ number of regions, because you can always increase the number of regions by adding a twist.

  - How can we tell if planar projections are really the same? It sorta looks like a few of our examples might be the same.

    We saw that some of our knots were alternating, and some were <strike>knot</strike> not. Does that have anything to do with it?

    Cole even made a conjecture: <strong>If a knot is non-alternating, then it is possible to find a twist we can remove to make a simpler planar projection.</strong>

*Task 2.* Work with the knots we have made. Are any "the same"? Are any for sure "different"? How can you tell?


I'll start drawing the knots in a way that I can post here. They should be up some time during the day of the 26th.
