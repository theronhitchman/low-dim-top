title: Patterns, Pentagons &amp; Orbifolds
---

Today was more playtime with patterns.

First, we dicussed the patterns \#9a through 12 (the ninth through
thirteenth patterns) from the big packet I handed out last Thursday.
We introduced symbols \\(\times\\) for glide reflections and \\(\circle\\)
for "nothing but a pair of translations."

This gives us a complete way to describe patterns by their _signature_.

1. Look for mirror lines and kaleidoscope points and their orders
2. Look for gyration points (centers of rotation) and their orders
3. Look for "miracles": glide reflections
4. if you can't find _any_ of those, look for the pair of translations.

The signature is then some arrangement of our symbols like so:
\\[
\circle ABC\dots Z * abc\dots * lmn\dots \times\times\dots \times
\\]

Then we talked about the history of tiling the plane by pentagons. This is a cool
story. You can [learn more about it here.][pentagons]

Finally, we tried "folding up" our patterns so that we had some smallest fundamental unit
of the pattern. The point is to somehow put together all of those points which are
pattern-equivalent without joining together any points which are pattern-non-equivalent.
We did this for the pattern \#9b (a \\(*\times\\) pattern), and for the pattern
\#12 (a \\( \circle \\) pattern). We started thinking about the pattern with signature
\\( 3*3 \\). The objects you get when making these crazy identifications are called
"orbifolds." Each pattern has an associated orbifold, which is a kind of decorated
surface. The orbifold for \#b is a Moebius band. The orbifold for \#12 is a torus.



#### For Thursday, 22 October

Please do the following, some of which you have already begun.

1. Find the signature of each pattern in the dropbox folder.
2. Find the signatures for the 15 different tilings by pentagons.
2. Think through the orbifold of the pattern \\(3*3\\) that we worked on today.
3. Find the orbifolds of the other patterns in the packet I made.
