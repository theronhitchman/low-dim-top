title: Curves and homotopy
---

Today we did some administrative stuff: organizing who will present projects on
each day, and deciding for sure on peer reviewers for our papers.

Please bring drafts to class on Thursday, two copies!

Then we talked about how to use curves to tell spaces apart. The first big idea
is that the curves on a torus are more interesting than the curves on a sphere.
Every curve on a sphere can be deformed to a point. (This is a "homotopy.")
But there are lots of weird curves on a torus, and they cannot all be deformed
down to a point.

And if we have two interesting curves, we decided we could use them to make a new
curve by *concatenating* them. This makes a kind of thing that looks like a
multiplication.

idle homework: which properties of multiplication of numbers still work in this
context?

(maybe check Wikipedia for a list of properties of multiplication of numbers)
