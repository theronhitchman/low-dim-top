I'm asking for a friend.


So, anyway, we tried talking about what makes the "magic theorem" work the way
it does. There are two things to understand:

1. Why is the table of costs set up the way it is?
2. Why is the total cost always $2?

The answer to question 1 lies in "fractional counting" of features on the orbifold.
We started that counting, and I got lost. I made a dumb error, but we at least
started talking about it.

The answer to question 2 will use a clever counting argument where we will really
use the fact that the Euler characteristic of the sphere is 2. We started
by talking about how many different copies of a "smallest tile" we would find in
a circle of radius R, where R is some large number. This argument will also use
the idea of "stereographic projection." To prep for this bit, we watched
[this video][vid].
