title: Second Day of presentations
---

Three more presentations today, and Darian brought donuts. I really enjoyed the
presentations today. It was neat to see all of the pictures and hear some music.


  * Jessica showed us how to study spherical wallpaper patterns
  * Brittany showed us how to study frieze patterns
  * Nick showed us how to think about music written on a Mobius band, and played
  some for us!

Final Exam period is Thursday next week at 3pm. We will finish our presentations then!
