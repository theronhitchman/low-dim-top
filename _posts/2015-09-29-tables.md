title: The First Table of Surfaces
---

Today we talked more about surfaces -- in particular, we discussed some
details about the Euler characteristic.

The major points we discovered were these:

  * If you add a handle to a surface, then the Euler characteristic goes
  down by 2.
  * If you cut a hole in a surface, then the Euler characteristic goes down
  by 1, and the number of boundary components goes up by 1.

We used this information to make a table of orientable surfaces. In this
setup, the simplest orientable surface is the sphere, and then we can
obtain any other orientable surface by adding handles and cutting holes.

I put a copy of our table in the dropbox folder.

### Assignment for Next time: Figure out an analogous table for
non-orientable sufaces!

What might be the "simplest" non-orientable surface? So far, our suggestions
are the Klein bottle and the Mobius band.
