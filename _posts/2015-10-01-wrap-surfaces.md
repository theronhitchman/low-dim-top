title: Non-orientable surfaces &amp; Invariance of Euler characteristic
---

There were *two* big advances today, both having to do with our
understanding of the classification of surfaces. These are the last key
steps in our work, and with them we are ready for the final argument
for a complete description of all surfaces.

1. We talked about why the Euler characteristic is actually a number
associated to a surface, rather than to a sewing pattern on a surface.

2. We made a table for non-orientable surfaces! The root of this table is
_the projective plane_. This mysterious and difficult to draw surface is
made by adding a cross cap to a sphere. We checked that adding a cross cap
to a surface decreases its Euler characteristic by one.

#### For Tuesday:

Read through the "ZIP" proof of the classification of surfaces in Weeks.
(Either the paper I handed out or the book.)

Study up and bring questions for Tuesday. I will bring NO PLAN for Tuesday.
Instead, I plan to help lead you all in conversation about what is still
challenging.

Oh, and it should be possible now to identify all 18 of our surface
friends. Can you do it?

#### Exams Thursday next week on Knots and Surfaces
