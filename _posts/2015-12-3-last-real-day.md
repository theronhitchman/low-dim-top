title: Last Regular Meeting

Today was our last regular meeting. We finished our introduction to the Fundamental
group and the Poincare conjecture.

We did course evaluations.

We ate donuts.

We traded drafts of papers. Please comment on them and send those comments to their
authors early next week (Tuesday, Wednesday?).

Presentations will begin on Tuesday.
