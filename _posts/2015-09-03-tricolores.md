title: Tricolorability &amp; the shape of knot theory

---

I had a lot of fun in class today, and I hope you enjoyed it too. What did we
accomplish?

1. We continued our discussion of Dowker notation for knots. In particular, we
did a little more practice and we talked about how one might recognize simple
type 1 and type 2 Reidemeister moves by looking at the Dowker code for a knot. We
also talked about counting how many codes a given knot might have, and about how
many codes there would be for a knot of a given length.

2. We talked about the idea of an _invariant_. Then I introduced you to the simplest
knot invariant: _tricolorability_. We practiced on our 14 newest friends. (I am
still a little upset with myself for not putting the unknot on that list.) We
discussed how Reidemeister moves finally prove their worth by making it soooo
much easier to show that something is an invariant.

3. In the last five minutes, I made a mini-outline of the structure of knot theory.
The big questions are these:

  * How can we tell if two knots are the same?
  * How can we recognize a knot? What systems are there for describing a knot?
  * How can we tell if two knots are different?
  * Can we make a census of what kinds of knots there are?

I hope you recognize that we have spent time on the basics of these first three
questions. I have mentioned repeatedly that the fourth question has a partial
answer, but we didn't really talk about how that works -- the reason is that
making a census requires good answers for each of the three other questions.

#### Assignment for Tuesday, 9/8:

Read Prasolov's _Intuitive Topology_ through chapter 5. Part of this reading will
get into the idea of a surface.

#### Note about next week:

I will miss class both days, but I will arrange for materials to magically appear
for you to work through. Cole has graciously agreed to take short notes and write
an email to me about your progress so I can keep up with you.
