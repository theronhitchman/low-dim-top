title: Another Mess

We discussed possible project ideas. To avoid overlaps, and to spur imaginations
I'll record what I remember here:

| Student        | Idea               |
| :------------- | :----------------- |
| Ben            | Study 3d spaces    |
| Sarah          | A knot invariant   |
| Brittany       | Frieze patterns    |
| Jessica        | Spherical Patterns |
| Lindsey        | 3d print Seifert surfaces |
| Reggie         | a knot invariant   |
| Darian         | making a pattern?  |
| Cole           | programming a pattern maker |
| Nick           | music on a Mobius band |
| Arianna        | ??                 |
| Lauren         | A knot invariant   |

That is just what I remember. I am sure parts of that are wrong. I am sure that
Arianna hadn't made up her mind, but I am also sure that Sarah had picked out
something, but I can't recall exactly what.

Then I tried to lead you in the direction of "completing the Magic Theorem." But
I totally failed at this. I'll try again Thursday.

#### For Thursday

Bring a half page project proposal description. I want to help balance these.
