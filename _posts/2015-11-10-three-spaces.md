title: Three Dimensional Spaces
---

Today we began discussions of 3d spaces. I figure we need to get some experience
thinking about basic examples, so we started by looking at what you get by
identifying opposite faces on a cube. First we tried one pair of opposite faces,
glued by the identity map, then a quarter twist, then a half twist, then a
three-quarter twist, and finally a full twist. We looked at each of these
examples from the outside ('extrinsically') and from the inside ('intrinsically').

We then tried glueing a pair of opposite faces by identity maps. It took some
work to see it, but we eventually realized this was a "product" space: a torus
times an interval.

#### For Thursday, 12 November

Prepare for the second exam.

Consider what space you get when you identify all three pairs of opposite faces
of a cube by using the identity mapping. What does this look like? Can you draw it?
What does it look like from the outside? What does it look like to our intrepid
torch-carrying jetpacker?
