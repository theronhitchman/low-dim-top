title: Pattern Recognition
---

Today I was very silly.

Also, we learned to attach symbols to certain types of planar patterns. We
discussed "kaleidoscope points" and "gyration points" and tried not to
giggle. We studied a pack of patterns and identified patterns with these
"signatures":

 * \*632
 * \*442
 * 3\*3
 * 2\*22
 * 4\*2
 * 333

#### For Tuesday, 20 October

Work through the patterns in the rest of the packet and describe their
symmetries. Can you find a "minimal tile" for each pattern?

Also, look through the patterns you all found ---  they are in the dropbox
folder.
