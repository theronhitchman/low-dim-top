title: Symmetries &amp; Tessellations
---

Today we began our study of planar patterns. These are often called
"wallpaper patterns" because they can be used to make the designs for
wallpaper. In our case, we will study wallpaper patterns by looking
at their _symmetries_. We had lots of new words today, and we looked
at examples that came up by doing Google Image searches on these
search terms:

  * paving stone tessellations
  * Escher simple tessellations

We talked about the four different types of symmetries that a planar pattern
can have:

  + translation by a certain distance in a certain direction
  + rotation about a certain point of a certain "order"
  + reflection across a certain line
  + glide reflection along a certain line by a certain distance.

By the way, it is important to remember that to a mathematician, the word
"symmetry" is a noun. A symmetry is a motion which when performed leaves
the picture looking the same.

We found examples of all of these symmetries by looking at patterns on the
internet.

#### For Thursday, October 15

Find several examples of patterns in your walking around time. Take
pictures and send them to me.

I didn't ask you to do this before, but it will help you to start looking
at the patterns you find and see what symmetries are present. I don't need
you to report them, yet, but you should look!
