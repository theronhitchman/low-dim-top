title: Knots and Surfaces Discussion Day
---

Today was our last conversation before the exam. We talked about the way
surfaces work, and a bit about what we learned about knots.

And I went off on some crazy tangents. I think I might even have used the
term "energon cube" at some point. I will try to be better next time.

Current Exam Schedule:

And I made arrangements with Lindsey to meet on Wednesday during lunch.

My office is Wright Hall 327. That is the top floor. If you want one there
is an elevator at the south end of the building. I am closer to the
northwest corner.
