Sarah told us about the basics of braids, and how they relate to knots and links.

Ben showed us how he learned to think about making 3d spaces by gluing the sides
of a tetrahedron.

Lauren showed us how to compute the Jones polynomial for knots and links, and in
the process proved that several of our old friends are actually distinct!

Very good job by all. More Thursday.
