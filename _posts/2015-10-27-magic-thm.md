title: A bit of Magic and the 17 allowed patterns
---

Today I shared the statement of the "magic theorem." This says that

 1. to each part of the signature there is an associated cost
 2. the total cost of a wallpaper pattern signature is exactly \$2.

You then used this to deduce a complete list of the allowed wallpaper pattern
signatures, using basic arithmetical reasoning:

     632,  442,  333,  2222,  O
    *632, *442, *333, *2222, **
           4*2,  3*3,  2*22, *x
                        22*, xx
                        22x

This list has 17 different allowed signatures. We looked through the examples we
have seen so far, in our packet and in the page of pentagonal tilings, and we
found examples of all but three! The as-yet-unrealized signatures were:

    *333, *2222, and 22*.

We figured out how to make patterns which realize the first two, using an equilateral
triangle and a rectangle, respectively.

#### For Thursday

Design a pattern that has signature 22*.

Also, bring project ideas. I'll update my list of project seed ideas on this site
in a few minutes.
