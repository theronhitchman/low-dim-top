title: Reidemeister Moves

---

Early reports indicate that we think perhaps Nick and Reggie are the same knot. Also, perhaps Arianna, Joellen, Cole, and Lauren are the same knot.

We played an identification game for a while, which went amazingly well. I am really impressed with your ability to recognize some of these knots.

We learned many new words today: _crossing_, _ambient isotopy_, _connected sum_, _chiral_, _achiral_, _mirror image_, and _Reidemeister move_. Those are the ones I recall. Were there others?

We talked about the basics of Reidemeister moves, including three (not so easy to prove) theorems. (Reidemeister, Haken, and Hass-Lagarias)

Then we **tried it**. This is always a challenge. In the end, we did find a way to do a sequence of Reidemeister moves that identified the pair of knots labeled (3) on the handout. [I drew it nicely on my ipad and put it in the dropbox folder.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9t0ve06s23nurxo/first-moves.png?dl=0)

#### Assignment for Tuesday 9/1:

Start reading Prasolov if you haven't already.

Find sequences of Reidemeister moves that handle the other cases in your handout from today. Draw a sequence of pictures that shows the moves necessary.

If you still need more challenges: See if you can use a sequence of Reidemeister moves to justify the assertions in the first paragraph of this post.
